# Temple Crowdfunding Platform

**Live Demo:** [https://temple-crowdfunding-8o3g.vercel.app](https://temple-crowdfunding-8o3g.vercel.app/)  

Temples are the heart of our culture, but many of them need renovations and care. This platform is my attempt to make donating easier, transparent, and meaningful. Here, anyone can create a campaign, donate securely, and track the progress of temple renovations.  

Built with **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP animations**, itâ€™s designed to be both functional and visually appealing. Payments are handled with **Razorpay**, ensuring everything is safe and smooth.  

The idea is not just to build a website, but a **real-world project** that looks professional, works seamlessly, and can be showcased to top companies.
